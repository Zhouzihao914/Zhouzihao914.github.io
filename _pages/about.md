I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford, major in electrical engineering, supervised by Prof. [David Howey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-MOqkMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research interests locate on energy storage system (mainly lithium-ion battery), control and machine learning. Details can be found in my [CV](https://Zhouzihao914.github.io/files/zzh_resume.pdf).

Before joining Oxford, I obained my Bachelor's degree on Material Physics in 2018 from Nanjing University of Science and Technology. From 2018 to 2021, I earned my MSc degree in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Xuan Zhang](http://www.tbsi.edu.cn/zx_en/main.htm). Thanks to the dual degree program, I also hold a M.Eng degree in Industrial Engineering and Operation Research from the University of California, Berkeley.
